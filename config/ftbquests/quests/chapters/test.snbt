So it was largely ignored as novelty and nothing more, save perhaps as display candy for eccentrics. What we’ve found though is that the precision of the forge allows Stellarite and Xpetrified to interact in a fantastical way. The result is a substance that seems to, without exception, resist damage and age. This is great news for your equipment, but it also intersects conveniently with Ars Nouveau."

Yet, the nature of this particular dimension is largely unknown and shrouded in darkness. I’d be surprised if anyone else knew about this place in the present day."

After spending some time recalling our initial research, we remembered something that Wings noted in her experiments - the tiniest remnants of a rare magical property. If our hypothesis holds, what you’re after may transform the entire way we view reality. In other words, you may be able to change the world as we know it."

In fact, we suspect that the very evil much of the world contains is due to ancient mages attempting to play with souls and spirits outside of their natural function. In the end, the people who pursue arcana of this kind are consumed by their desire for power. If you attempt training through this book, we unfortunately will never condone anything you would learn or become capable of. You may even become completely corrupted by it. Our desire to set the world in order means that we cannot allow you to compromise that goal through foolish pursuits. If you truly are unified with us in vision and principle, burn the book. Do not become the Julanar of your time…"]
